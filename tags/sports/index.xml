      <description>Now, Iâ€™ll give out some warnings here. I have played sports since I was the young age of 4. I grew up playing baseball, football, soccer, and ice hockey. My only exception to the sport of basketball was that I played guard in the 8th grade because I was pretty tall for my age. So I technically played one season of basketball even though I only played probably a whopping 20 minutes all year, probably 8 games.</description>
