<p>Well, when you’re at a young age like I am in college, you have to try some things you’ve never tried before to get that experience! No, it’s not what you think I’m talking about. I’m talking about making a NCAA March Madness Tournament Bracket. What did you think I was talk- you know what never mind, that’s besides the point.</p>
<p>Now, I’ll give out some warnings here. I have played sports since I was the young age of 4. I grew up playing baseball, football, soccer, and ice hockey. My only exception to the sport of basketball was that I played guard in the 8th grade because I was pretty tall for my age. So I technically played one season of basketball even though I only played probably a whopping 20 minutes all year, probably 8 games.</p>
<p>My knowledge of basketball is very close to about a rock when it comes to knowing data analytics and such in basketball because I just don’t follow or watch the sport that much. I was too busy playing hockey during the basketball season and I’ll be upfront, I am horrible at basketball. All I have for a skill set in basketball is that I could pass using my hockey ability and be able to run up and down the court because of my soccer, baseball, and hockey ability.</p>
<p>So, with my very little knowledge about basketball, I was told to take some stats and make a March Madness bracket out of who I thought had the best stats in certain areas. Want to hear my reasoning of why I chose what I did? ALL OFFENSE, NO DEFENSE! Now, the reason I say this is because I didn’t say I’ve never watch basketball before, I just have no interest in playing it or following it that much. If it is on at a sports bar, I’ll probably glance over at it here and there and one thing I notice the most, especially playing sports where defense is very crucial and important, is that players either very rarely play defense or not at all and I mean coming back to defend and actually pick up their man. So I decided to take all offensive stats of this past college basketball season and run RStudio based on that and hopefully pick my winning team from that!</p>
