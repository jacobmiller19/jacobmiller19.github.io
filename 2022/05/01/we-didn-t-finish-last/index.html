<p>Like in my last blog post, there is always a first for everything, including sports gambling. That is what we finished this semester with in out SPMC 460 class.</p>
<p>Although I have been to Las Vegas to gamble, I have never done sports gambling before and it was definitely a new experience that I may be interested in when it gets passed in Nebraska or wherever I move to but I will more than likely bet hockey games.</p>
<p>Our method was using team rolling true shooting percentage, team rolling free throw factor, team rolling turnover percentage, team rolling orb, team rolling defensive rebound, opponent rolling true shooting percentage, opponent rolling free throw factor, opponent rolling turnover percentage, opponent rolling offensive rebounding, opponent rolling defensive rebounding, team rolling defensive efficiency, opponent rolling defensive efficiency, team rolling offensive efficiency, and opponent rolling offensive efficiency to our code and with this, we thought this would be the best option to run the best code to determine winners.</p>
<p>The algorithm we used was logistical regression because again, we thought we’d have the best chance to find the teams with the best outcomes to win and win the bigger money bets.</p>
<p>Our human intervention for our betting ideas was to generally bet one favorite and one underdog, whichever had to the best money line for us to win a lot of money.</p>
<p>We also said let’s bet two or three underdogs and that never went well for us ever so we finished that idea.</p>
<p>And our final idea was to go two or three favorites and try and get some of our money back.</p>
<p>Again most of our teams that we bet on had to do with out code and more for the better money line teams as well.</p>
<p>We collectively came together on a decision on who would have the better probability on winning the game that night and we also looked at the amount of money we would also win back</p>
<p>For our record and overall position, we finished at 10 winning bets and 11 losing bets and ended up finishing in fourth place after we bet 899 dollars out of our 900.03 dollar budget that we had left on Memphis for the final game on Friday and hit on that game and finished at a total of $1649.20.</p>
<p>I feel like our record was OK, obviously it could be better, but for three people that really didn’t have too much of an idea for sports betting, to come out with 149 more dollars that you started with is always a plus.</p>
<p>What I learned during this assignment and betting is that our model was good for betting, we just didn’t get lucky like some of the other groups did and to never bet on two underdogs because more than likely you’ll lose your money. Always go for two favorites or an underdog and favorite.</p>
