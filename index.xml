      <description>Like in my last blog post, there is always a first for everything, including sports gambling. That is what we finished this semester with in out SPMC 460 class.
Although I have been to Las Vegas to gamble, I have never done sports gambling before and it was definitely a new experience that I may be interested in when it gets passed in Nebraska or wherever I move to but I will more than likely bet hockey games.</description>

      <description>Now, Iâ€™ll give out some warnings here. I have played sports since I was the young age of 4. I grew up playing baseball, football, soccer, and ice hockey. My only exception to the sport of basketball was that I played guard in the 8th grade because I was pretty tall for my age. So I technically played one season of basketball even though I only played probably a whopping 20 minutes all year, probably 8 games.</description>
